# BMW Sales Dashboard (2010–2024)

This dashboard is built in Power BI to analyze BMW car sales from 2010 to 2024.  
The aim was to understand which models performed well, how different fuel types contributed to overall sales, and how price and engine size are related.  
The report also covers regional trends and customer preferences

# What the Dashboard Shows

1. Model Selector 
Each BMW model is shown with an image.  
Selecting a model updates the whole report, making it easy to compare sales across different series like 3 Series, 5 Series, i3, M-series, X-series, etc.

2. Sales by Fuel Type
A bar chart compares Hybrid, Electric, Petrol and Diesel sales.  
Hybrid has the highest volume, followed by Electric and Petrol.  
This clearly shows BMW’s growing shift toward EV and hybrid segments.

3. Transmission Split
A donut chart shows how many cars were Manual vs Automatic.  
The ratio is almost equal, which means both types of customers still exist in the market.

4. Safety Rating 
Another donut chart shows high-rated and low-rated vehicles.  
This helps to quickly understand product quality trends over the years.

5. Price vs Engine Size
A scatter plot shows how average price changes with engine size (2L to 5L).  
Higher engine sizes generally have higher prices.  
Most prices fall between 70K–80K USD.

6. Region-wise Sales
A simple bar chart compares sales from Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa, South America and North America.  
Europe and Asia are the strongest regions for BMW.

7. Sales by Model
This chart highlights which model sold the most.  
The M5 stands out with the highest sales volume of all models.

8. Global Price Map
A map visual shows how average price varies by region.  
Europe and North America have higher average prices compared to other regions.

9. Average Price Card
A KPI card shows the average price for the selected model.  
For example, the M5 has an average price of around 744K USD.
